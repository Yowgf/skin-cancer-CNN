MD-TP3 project plan
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This document tries to settle a plan for the MD-TP3 project,
according to CRISP-DM directives, and past experience.

First off, I must follow the CRISP-DM guidelines. These have proven
to be extremely useful and realistic. Don't be fooled into thinking
you have a better template.

We then have 6 phases, each one with a few tasks. Each one of these
must be done in order (with necessary iterations). The phases are:

1. Business understanding
2. Data understanding
3. Data preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

Let's first establish what our past experience is with each task,
and then we can move to the first phase which includes the making of
the initial plan. The past experience report is in the file
"<root>/doc/cdm/past-exp-report.txt"

I plan to include the first phase progress in the directory
"<root>/doc/cdm/phs1".
