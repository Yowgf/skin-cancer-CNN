Notes on findings on our dataset, while trying to start phase 1 of
the project.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The data is actually quite big, and needs to occupy approximately
150228 * 1600 bytes in the full matrix. So there is a very real
concern with memory, and how we treat the main data matrix. It also
has serious implications on the methods we will be able to use.

For a starter, we can say that dimensionality reduction is
absolutely necessary. Also, it is important to remember that the
pixels values range from 0 to 255, and so only ONE BYTE is necessary
for each. Using more than one byte per pixel might slow down
everything drastically.
