Notes on the day in which I plan to complete the first phase of the
MD-TP3 project.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The data doesn't need to be rescaled, since all the pixels values
lie in the range [0, 255].

I decided to sample the image with 4x4 blocks. The current size of
the data is intractible for the sklean's PCA algorithm, and also for
my algoritm (buildReDf). The memory and CPU consumed is simply too
high.

For that, I built the function sampleImages(), in the file
"<root>/pysrc/phs1.py". Now, loadImgDataset returns should return
the classes and the sample data, in a tuple.

The next question that needs an answer is: how do I put everything
into a single 2d dataset?
