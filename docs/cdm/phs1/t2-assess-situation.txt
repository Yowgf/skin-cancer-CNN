MD-TP3 project task 2 of phase 1 of CRISP-DM
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Schedule of completion: 2021-03-15

The dataset is public, it comes from the link "data_source", that
may be found in the file "<root>/doc/useful-links.txt".

I decided to generate a small yaml file with the metadata of the
dataset, concretely the source, original publisher, that kind of
stuff. This way, if one need this kind of information, they may
easily encouter them in the said yaml file.

The biggest constraints are listed below:

1. Lack of knowledge in the skin cancer field, and lack of available
technical personell

2. Hardware -- the dataset is quite big, my computer might not be
able to handle it.

Assumptions:

- Data is correct

- Collected data from Kaggle has been uniformely selected from
  origin

- Data is sufficient for our purpose of defining a malign cancer
