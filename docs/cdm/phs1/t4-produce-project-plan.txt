MD-TP3 project task 4 of phase 1 of CRISP-DM
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Producing the project plan should maybe be done in steps, while
building the other tasks. I think this is actually largely the
result of the whole thought process that underwent the last few
tasks.

The steps are to be listed in as much detail as possible, at this
stage. The project plan can be found in the file
"<root>/doc/cdm/phs1/outputs/project-plan.txt".
