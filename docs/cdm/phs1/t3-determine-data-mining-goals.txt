MD-TP3 project task 3 of phase 1 of CRISP-DM
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The data mining goals. These relate to the business goals described
in task one.

For the primary objective, the corresponding data mining objective
is to classify the data such that test error is bound by F-SCORE of:

  F-SCORE = 2 / ((1/precision) + (1/recall)) >= 90% on test data
  (for example if the precision and recall are both 0.90, you will
  get a 90% F-SCORE.)

The secondary business objectives are absolutely subjective. As
such, I will judge them myself, based on base-knowledge found
through research.
